A simple extension to the Jabber class by Centova Technologies Inc. (http://www.centova.com)

The Jabber class is an *awesome* class. I love it. But getting a bot up and running took quite a bit of code... Jabber Simple aims to, uh, simplify that. :)

Jabber Simple simplifies things by:

  * Automatically connecting and logging into the Jabber Server
  * Automatically discovering the handler methods
  * Potential for simple and clean code
